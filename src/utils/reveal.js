 * whether it has been reached. Nothing is wrapped, so the markup and layout stay
 * exactly as they were; the caller spreads `revealSx` into the element's own sx.
 *
 * Reveals do not replay when you scroll back up. On a page this long that reads
 * as the content flickering rather than as an effect.
